Make the data into a table. Click somewhere in the table. Go to the Data tab and click "From Table/Range".
The power query window will pop up.

Select all columns except for the address column and then choose "Group By".
In the "New column name" field, input whatever you want your new column
to be called. In the Operation dropdown, choose "Sum". In the Column
dropdown, choose "Address".

The new column will populate with Errors. That is okay. We have to fix a
couple of things in the formua. In the formula, find where it says
"List.Sum" (this will be near the end). Replace it with "Text.Combine".
Then, after the column name in brackets right after Text.Combine, add a
comma, and then in parentheses, add what you want your delimiter to be
(the separate between multiple addresses.
The final product for that section should look like this: 
Text.Combine([Address], ", ").

Then choose Close & Load.

It's important to note that if anything is different between a realtors
multiple listings. So a different city or phone number, for example,
this combining method will not work. Sometimes I run this twice, and
before the second time, I go through and make sure all the information
other than the addresses are the same. Amanda said we do not care about
accuracy in the City. So we can just copy the first city down through a
realtors other listings. Sort and Highlight Duplicates in Conditional
Formatting works great for finding these.

This is not perfect, it won't catch all of them, but it will catch most
of them. You can do the rest manually afterwards

Add an "and" after the last comma:
=SUBSTITUTE(cell,",",", and",LEN(cell)-LEN(SUBSTITUTE(cell,",","")))
